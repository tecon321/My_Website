                a machine learning model to predict the winner of NBA basketball games. I coded the project in Python

                        Python package to build by own web scraper that scraped all the statistics in efficient
                        manner from sportsreference.com. The data was then stored in Pandas Data Frames and
                        exported into local .csv files. </td>

                        manipulatable formats for my model. This included changing the data types of
                        various statistics, concatenating game results from monthly tables into
                        full season tables, eliminating playoff games, etc. Then, I built my own functions to calculate
                        certain statistics that weren't included in the original data. For example
                        I converted game dates into date-time format and calculated the number of days rest each
                        team had going into a game. </td>

                        <td>Once all the data was collected, cleaned and reformatted, I built a stratified K-fold
                        evaluator to partition my data into training and testing sets. For all my models, predictions were
                        made on single games, where the model inputs were all team and opponent statistics for the two teams
                        involved in the game during the season the game took place. The output for the prediction funcions
                        for each model was binary: 1 if the home team is predicted to win, and 0 if the away team should win.
                        I used the Sklearn decision tree classifier as a baseline weak learner, and the Random Forest ensamble.
                        Additionally I built my own Bagging and AdaBoost ensamble methods.</td>

                        and numbers of K-fold partitions, the resulting predictions were shockingly accurate. The best
                        performing model was the Random Forest ensamble, correctly predicting the winner of every game since
                        1990 with a mean accuracy of 69.3216% over a 4-fold partition. My bagging ensamble also performed well
